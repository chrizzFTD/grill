Views (Inspecting / Authoring)
==============================

The ``grill.views`` package provides Qt widgets to author and inspect USD scene graphs.

Convenience launchers and menus for **USDView**, **Houdini** and **Maya** are provided (appearing under the ``üë®‚Äçüç≥ Grill`` menu), but any DCC or environment with ``USD`` and ``PySide2`` should be able to use the widgets.
